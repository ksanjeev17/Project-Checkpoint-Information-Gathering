		<p>Hi! My name is Kushal Sanjeev and I am a sophomore business student at the University of Michigan.</p>

		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>I am originally from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan which is about an hour away from campus but I have always loved to travel and explore new places. In my free time, you can find me outside playing tennis, basketball, or staying active with friends and family. I am also a very big NBA fan and an amateur home cook.</p>
